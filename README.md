# SpotifyApi
  .NET Project that invokes some of Spotify's APIs

# Requirements
  - Spotify Account
  - Spotify developer dashboard 

# How use it
  - Clone the repository in local
  - Set appsettings with your data: clientId, clientSecret and redirectUrl set up in the Spotify developer dashboard
  - Run the solution
  - It saves the url of your project when it's running, because you'll have to pass it to the frontend project also made by me in React js. You can always find the repositoty of the latter in my GitHub profile. Go visit it and download it now.

# Resources
